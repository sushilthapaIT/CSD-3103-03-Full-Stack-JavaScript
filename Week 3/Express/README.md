### Install Express => npx install express-generator

In the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Express is a lightweight web framework used with Node.js to handle the backend logic. Here's how it fits into the stack:

1. Middleware Framework: Express acts as middleware, allowing you to handle requests, routes, and responses between the front-end (React) and the database (MongoDB).
2. Routing: It simplifies routing by allowing you to define API endpoints for your web application. You can map different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific functions or routes.
3. Handling Requests and Responses: Express helps process incoming requests, such as form data or JSON, and send appropriate responses back to the front-end.
4. Integration with MongoDB: Express easily integrates with MongoDB, allowing you to perform database operations using models and controllers.
5. Middleware Plugins: You can add middleware functions to handle tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, and serving static files.
